# Introduction

This notebook is focussed on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Amazon movie reviews. The aim is to utilise the customer review to predict how the customer rated the film. 

The dataset that has been provided has been taken from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dm4006/amazon-movie-reviews).

Keras as a high-level interface to tensorflow will be used as the deep learning framework.
